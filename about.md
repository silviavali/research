### TallinnSec meetup series

I am also one of the board members and organisators of TallinnSec technical IT security meetups [https://www.tallinnsec.ee](https://www.tallinnsec.ee) which began in 2018. The first event took place at the Ülemiste City Technopolis when Solita Oy (Iiro Uusitalo) came up with the very first event. From there on I have been active in trying to advance the Estonian IT security scene by organizing meetups/trainings.
