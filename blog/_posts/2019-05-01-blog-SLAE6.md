This blog post has been created for completing the requirements of the [SecurityTube Linux Assembly Expert Certification](https://www.pentesteracademy.com/course?id=7). The task for 6/7 assignment is to take up to 3 shellcodes from shell-storm and create polymorphic versions of those samples to beat pattern matching. The requirement is that the polymorphic versions cannot be larger than the 150% of the existing shellcode.

<b>Student ID</b>: SLAE64 - 1594

### Shellcode 1 - `execve()`

The [first shellcode](http://shell-storm.org/shellcode/files/shellcode-603.php) I chose from the Shell-Storm website was a generic 64-bit `execve()` shellcode which is 30 bytes long. So, I created a polymorphic version with the length of 43 bytes (less than 150% of the original shellcode). On the picture below I have shown which exact instructions got replaced with something else and then continue to explain each desicion one step at a time.

__1__ - Instead of the `push rax` marked in yellow, I decided to `xor rdx, rdx` first and use that instead, as I would be needing to set `rdx` zero anyway to prepare it for the `execve()` syscall.

__2__ - I also decided to replace the `push rbx` (in green) from the original shellcode in a manner where I could get the same result but via another register. For that I simply chose to move the value in `rbx` to another register which I then push'ed instead.

__3__ - To prepare the 2nd argument `rsi` for the syscall, I took another way of first allocating space for it right after I had pushed 8 zero-bytes to the stack. Then moved the value from `rdi` to an address appointed to by the stack pointer (so right to the spot which I just allocated) and moved that address to `rsi`.

__4__ - since I did not clean the `rax` register somewhere earlier, I made sure it was zeroed out before loading the syscall number to it and executed the syscall.

### Shellcode 2 - `execveat()`

Going through shellcodes at Shell-Storm, I came by a [shellcode](http://shell-storm.org/shellcode/files/shellcode-905.php) which used the `execveat()` syscall. I had never tried it myself before so seemed an interesting way to go with that one. I ended up with a 31 byte long polymorphic version of that shellcode, so only 2 bytes longer than the original one.

__1__ - the author of the original shellcode wanted to prepare the syscall number 0x142 for `execveat()` as the very first thing. Without loading the value directly to its intended register `rax`, he loaded a value 0x42 and then incremented the `ah` by 1 ending up with the value 0x142. I decided to go the other way around and substract 1 from 0x143 instead, ending up with the same result.

__2__ - `cqo` is an intresting instruction, which doubles the size of the operand in register `ax/eax/rax` and stores the result as `dx:ax/edx:eax/rdx:rax`. so basically what happens here is that `rdx` register will simply be zerod out, because of sign-extending. We can get the same result by xor'ing `rdx` with itself.

__3__ - the instructions marked in blue, where the program name "/bin/sh" is placed eventually to the top of the stack with `push reg` instruction, I simply used another register (`rdi` --> `rcx`).

__4__ - I removed the lines marked in red, as there was no need for those instructions. This ended up shortening my shellcode a little bit as well.


### Shellcode 3 - `execve()`

[Shellcode](http://shell-storm.org/shellcode/files/shellcode-806.php) number 3 is 27 bytes in length and quite much similar to the first one, but gets the program name for `rdi` by negating the value in `rbx`. I decided to go with the `imul` instruction instead as you can see on the image below.

__1__ - I chose to substract the value in `rax` from itself, ending up with a zero.

__2__ - Next I moved the value 0xEEBE234583299 to `rbx`. Multiplying it with 0x7 `EEBE234583299 Ã— 7 = 68732F6E69622F` and converting this hex value to ascii, will give us the string `/bin/sh`.

__3__ - `cdq` replacement with `mov rdx, rax` allowed me to have the same effect of zeroing out `rdx` as I assured earlier that the value in `rax` would be zero.

__4__ - Finally the `pop rsi` instruction. What pop essentially does is that it takes the value stored at an address pointed to by `rsp` and places that value into rsi. As a side-effect, `rsp` is incremented by 8. So, by using the `mov rsi, [rsp]` I am going for the value stored at an address `rsp` and moving it to `rsi`. Then with `add rsp, 0x8` I increment the `rsp` as this is what would happen automatically if I used the `pop` instruction.

So what we learnt?

* `cqo` is good to use when you try to zero out rdx by sign-extending the value in rax
* We can switch up the registers we use in our shellcode super easily
* We can use various combinations of instructions to end up with the same result value
